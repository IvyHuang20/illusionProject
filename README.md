I am a student in a course on illusion programming.
In class, we use code to attempt to recreate classic illusion images or animations and try creating our own illusions.
Here, I'll share my project code for everyone's reference.

The first project is an illusion about color change, created using p5.js. 
The output consists of diagonal lines of red and green dots continuously shifting from left to right. When viewed, these dots may appear as yellow.
